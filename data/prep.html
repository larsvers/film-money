Sometimes they don’t expect to make any money and do. The joy of looking at Film costs and revenues comes from 2 main properties: Being stunned at how a sizeable investment can in fact accrue mountains of returned gold as well as dropping the same jaw at how lakes of invested money sometimes evaporate through empty screens. Films are bets on human taste that must entertain a lot of people. They often consume rhinoculous amounts of effort, people, skill, scream and shout to get into the public sphere which decides about their rise or fall. This modest piece offers a glimpse into this world of ups and downs, portraying a handful of stories, surprises and failures. (<a href=''>you can read about the data here</a>)"			}
